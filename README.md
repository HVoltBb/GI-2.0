This is a follow-up analysis of a previous study, which left several important questions unanswered due to length/page limitations. Here, I address 3 questions, including two (rather important) technical questions and one biological question. Personally, I like the first two, but I am pretty sure it is the 3rd one that will catch readers' eyes. Anyway, these topics are presented together such that the final product does not put most of you or me to sleep.
